The Apollo 11 mission, launched on July 16, 1969, was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins aboard. The Lunar Module, named "Eagle," separated from the Command Module "Columbia" on July 20, 1969, and Armstrong and Aldrin landed in the Sea of Tranquility at 2:56 UTC, with Armstrong famously declaring, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," as he stepped onto the lunar surface. The mission lasted a total of 8 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 35 seconds, with the astronauts spending about 21 hours on the Moon, including 2 hours and 15 minutes outside the Lunar Module. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar samples and conducted experiments before rejoining Collins in the Command Module on July 21. Apollo 11 safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, and the crew was subsequently quarantined for 21 days to prevent potential contamination from lunar pathogens.
