The Flint Water Crisis, which began in April 2014, involved the unethical decision to switch Flint, Michigan's water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money, leading to widespread lead contamination. Key figures in this controversy included then-Governor Rick Snyder and former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, who prioritized cost-cutting over public health. Despite numerous complaints from residents about the water's color and taste, officials, including the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, downplayed the risks, with Dr. Eden Wells stating in 2015 that the water was "safe to drink." The crisis resulted in elevated blood lead levels in children, with over 9,000 children affected, and a public health emergency was declared in January 2016. The ethical implications of neglecting community health and failing to respond to residents' concerns have led to ongoing legal battles and calls for accountability, including charges against several state officials.
