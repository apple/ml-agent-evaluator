The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to major corporate scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom, to oversee the audits of public companies. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the PCAOB's primary mission is to protect investors by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. As of October 2023, the PCAOB is led by Chair Erica Williams, who was appointed in 2021, and it oversees more than 2,000 registered public accounting firms. The PCAOB conducts inspections of these firms to assess their compliance with auditing standards, with the results published annually; for example, in 2022, they reported that 30% of inspected audits had deficiencies. Additionally, the PCAOB has been involved in international cooperation efforts, such as its 2022 agreement with the China Securities Regulatory Commission to enhance audit oversight for U.S.-listed companies.
