The Famous Marshmallow Experiment, conducted by psychologist Walter Mischel in the late 1960s at Stanford University, primarily focused on delayed gratification and self-control in children. In the study, 600 preschool-aged children were presented with a choice: they could eat one marshmallow immediately or wait 15 minutes to receive two marshmallows. Mischel observed that about one-third of the children were able to wait for the larger reward, while the rest succumbed to the temptation of the immediate treat. Follow-up studies revealed that those who demonstrated greater self-control tended to have better life outcomes, including higher SAT scores and better coping skills. The experiment has since become a foundational study in psychology, illustrating the importance of self-regulation and its long-term effects on personal development.
