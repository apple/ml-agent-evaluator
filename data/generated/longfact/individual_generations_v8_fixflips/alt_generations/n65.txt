The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established on April 4, 1949, with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., by 12 founding member countries, including the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations. NATO's primary purpose is to ensure collective defense, as articulated in Article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all; this principle was invoked for the first time after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The organization has expanded over the years, with 30 member countries as of 2023, including recent additions like Montenegro (2017) and North Macedonia (2020). Key military operations include the Kosovo Force (KFOR) established in 1999 and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. NATO's headquarters is located in Brussels, Belgium, and its current Secretary General is Jens Stoltenberg, who has held the position since October 1, 2014.
