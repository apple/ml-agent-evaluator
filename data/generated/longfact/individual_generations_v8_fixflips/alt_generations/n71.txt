Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) was a prominent German physician, pathologist, and anthropologist, often referred to as the "father of modern pathology." He is best known for his assertion that "omnis cellula e cellula," meaning that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, which laid the groundwork for cellular pathology. Virchow was also a significant figure in public health reform, notably during the cholera outbreak in Berlin in 1848, where he advocated for improved sanitation and social conditions to combat disease. He founded the journal "Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie" in 1846, which became a leading publication in pathology. Additionally, Virchow was involved in politics, serving as a member of the German Reichstag from 1880 to 1884, where he championed social medicine and health reforms.
