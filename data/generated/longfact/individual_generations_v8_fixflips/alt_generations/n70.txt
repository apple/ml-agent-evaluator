The Asch Conformity Experiments, conducted by psychologist Solomon Asch in the early 1950s, aimed to investigate the extent to which social pressure from a majority group could influence an individualâ€™s judgment. In a series of experiments held at Swarthmore College in 1951, participants were asked to match the length of a line to three comparison lines, with confederates (actors) deliberately giving incorrect answers. Asch found that about 75% of participants conformed to the group's incorrect consensus at least once, despite the clear evidence of their own perceptions. The experiments highlighted the power of group pressure, demonstrating that individuals often prioritize group harmony over their own accurate judgments. This phenomenon was particularly evident when participants were placed in groups of 7 to 9, where the unanimous incorrect responses from confederates led to significant conformity among the naive participants.
