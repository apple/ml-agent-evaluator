Mount Kilimanjaro, located in Tanzania, is the highest peak in Africa, standing at 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level. It is a dormant stratovolcano composed of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira, with Kibo being the highest point. The mountain was first successfully summited by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller on October 6, 1889. Kilimanjaro is a popular trekking destination, with routes such as the Marangu, Machame, and Lemosho, attracting thousands of climbers each year; in 2019, approximately 35,000 trekkers attempted to reach the summit. The surrounding Kilimanjaro National Park, established in 1973, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to diverse ecosystems, including rainforests, alpine deserts, and glaciers.
