The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was established in 1994 as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework during the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, which took place from 1986 to 1994. TRIPS sets minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) across member countries, covering areas such as copyright, trademarks, and patents, with a notable requirement for patent protection lasting at least 20 years. One significant event related to TRIPS was the 2001 Doha Declaration, which emphasized the importance of public health and allowed countries to prioritize access to medicines over patent rights, particularly in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. The agreement has faced criticism for its impact on developing countries, as seen in the protests at the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle, where activists argued that TRIPS could hinder access to essential medicines. Overall, TRIPS has played a crucial role in shaping global IPR policies, influencing trade relations and economic development worldwide.
