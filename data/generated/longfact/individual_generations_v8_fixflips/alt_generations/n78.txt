Roald Hoffmann is a Polish-American chemist born on July 18, 1937, in Złoczów, Poland, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981 alongside Kenichi Fukui for their work on the theory of chemical reactions. Hoffmann is particularly known for his contributions to computational chemistry and molecular orbital theory, which have significantly advanced the understanding of chemical bonding and reaction mechanisms. He developed the "Hoffmann rules," which help predict the outcomes of chemical reactions based on molecular orbital interactions. Hoffmann has also authored several influential books and papers, including "Chemistry Imagined: Reflections on Science" (2008), which explores the intersection of science and art. He has held academic positions at institutions such as Cornell University, where he has been a faculty member since 1965, influencing generations of chemists.
