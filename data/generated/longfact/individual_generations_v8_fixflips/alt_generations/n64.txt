The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066, near Hastings in East Sussex, England, and was a pivotal event in the Norman Conquest of England. The battle was fought between the Norman forces led by Duke William of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror, and the English army commanded by King Harold II. Harold's forces, numbering around 7,000, were primarily composed of infantry, while William's army, estimated at about 10,000, included cavalry and archers. The battle began around 9 AM and lasted until dusk, culminating in Harold's death, reportedly from an arrow to the eye, which led to the collapse of English resistance. The victory for William resulted in his coronation as King of England on December 25, 1066, fundamentally altering the course of English history and governance.
