Simone de Beauvoir was a French existentialist philosopher, feminist, and writer, born on January 9, 1908, in Paris, France. She is best known for her groundbreaking work "The Second Sex," published in 1949, which critically examined the construction of women's oppression and is considered a foundational text in feminist philosophy. De Beauvoir had a lifelong partnership with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and they were central figures in the intellectual circles of 20th-century Paris, often associated with existentialism and leftist politics. Throughout her life, she was involved in various social and political movements, including advocating for women's rights and participating in the feminist movement of the 1960s. De Beauvoir passed away on April 14, 1986, leaving a profound legacy that continues to influence feminist theory and existentialist thought.
