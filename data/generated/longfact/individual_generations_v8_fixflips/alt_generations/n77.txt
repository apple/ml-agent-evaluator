The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an international agreement that aims to ban all nuclear explosions for both civilian and military purposes, and it was opened for signature on September 24, 1996. As of October 2023, 170 countries have signed the treaty, and 137 have ratified it, but it has not yet entered into force because eight specific states listed in Annex 2, including the United States, China, and India, have not ratified it. The treaty established the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Organization (CTBTO), headquartered in Vienna, Austria, which is responsible for monitoring compliance through a global network of monitoring stations. Notably, North Korea's nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016 highlighted the challenges of enforcing the CTBT, as the country is not a signatory. The treaty represents a significant step towards nuclear disarmament, but its effectiveness is contingent upon the participation of key nuclear-capable states.
