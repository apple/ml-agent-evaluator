The Federal Reserve System, established on December 23, 1913, serves as the central bank of the United States, with a primary function of conducting monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It consists of twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York being particularly influential due to its role in implementing monetary policy and managing the country's foreign exchange reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes members of the Board of Governors and regional bank presidents, meets regularly to set key interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, which was set at 0.00% to 0.25% during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 to support the economy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in supervising and regulating banks to ensure the stability of the financial system, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis when it implemented emergency measures to stabilize the banking sector. Notable figures in the Federal Reserve's history include former Chair Janet Yellen, who served from 2014 to 2018, and current Chair Jerome Powell, who took office in February 2018 and has been pivotal in navigating economic challenges during the pandemic and subsequent recovery.
