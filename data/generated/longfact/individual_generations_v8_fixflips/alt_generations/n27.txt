The Herschel Space Observatory was a space telescope launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) on May 14, 2009, as part of the Cosmic Vision program. Named after the astronomer William Herschel, who discovered infrared radiation, the observatory was designed to observe the universe in the far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, with a primary mirror measuring 3.5 meters in diameter, making it the largest space telescope of its kind. Herschel's scientific mission included studying star formation, galaxy evolution, and the cosmic background radiation, and it operated until April 29, 2013, when it ran out of coolant for its instruments. The observatory made significant discoveries, such as detecting water vapor in the atmosphere of exoplanets and mapping the distribution of interstellar dust in galaxies. Key figures involved in the project included ESA's Herschel project scientist, Dr. GÃ¶ran Pilbratt, and the mission was a collaboration with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and NASA.
