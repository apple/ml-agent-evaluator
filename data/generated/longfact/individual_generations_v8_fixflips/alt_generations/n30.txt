The Y2K bug, also known as the Millennium Bug, was a computer programming issue that arose as the year 2000 approached, primarily due to the widespread practice of using two digits to represent the year, which could lead to systems interpreting "00" as 1900 instead of 2000. This concern was highlighted by figures such as Peter de Jager, a Canadian consultant who raised awareness about the potential problems in the 1990s, predicting failures in systems ranging from banking to utilities. Major events leading up to January 1, 2000, included extensive testing and remediation efforts by companies and governments worldwide, with estimates of costs reaching up to $600 billion in the United States alone. On New Year's Eve 1999, many people were on high alert, with some even stockpiling supplies in anticipation of possible disruptions, while locations like the United Nations held special meetings to address the issue. Ultimately, when the clock struck midnight on January 1, 2000, most systems transitioned smoothly, with only minor glitches reported, leading to a sense of relief and a sense that the extensive preparations had been successful.
