John Bolton is an American attorney, diplomat, and political commentator who served as the National Security Advisor under President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019. Born on November 20, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland, he is known for his hawkish foreign policy views, particularly regarding Iran and North Korea. Bolton played a significant role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, advocating for military intervention and the removal of Saddam Hussein, and he has been a prominent critic of the United Nations, calling for U.S. withdrawal from various international agreements. He has also held positions such as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 and Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. In 2020, Bolton published a memoir titled "The Room Where It Happened," which detailed his experiences in the Trump administration and criticized the president's foreign policy decisions.
