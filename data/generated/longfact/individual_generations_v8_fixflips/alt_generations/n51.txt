The Parmalat financial scandal, which came to light in December 2003, involved the Italian dairy and food corporation Parmalat S.p.A., revealing a massive accounting fraud that amounted to approximately €14 billion (around $20 billion at the time). The scandal was orchestrated by Parmalat's founder, Calisto Tanzi, who misled investors and regulators about the company's financial health, including the fabrication of assets and the concealment of debts. In December 2003, it was discovered that a €3.95 billion bank account supposedly held by Parmalat in a Cayman Islands bank did not exist, leading to the company's bankruptcy. The scandal resulted in the arrest of Tanzi and several other executives, with Tanzi later being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2008. The fallout from the scandal also led to significant regulatory changes in Italy and increased scrutiny of corporate governance practices across Europe.
