Richard J. Roberts is a British biochemist who, along with Phillip A. Sharp, discovered introns in eukaryotic DNA in 1977, a groundbreaking finding that revealed that genes are not continuous sequences of coding DNA but are interrupted by non-coding regions. This discovery was made while they were studying the adenovirus, leading to the understanding that eukaryotic genes undergo a process called splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together to form mature mRNA. The implications of this work were profound, as it transformed the understanding of gene expression and regulation, influencing fields such as genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. Roberts and Sharp were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993, sharing the honor with Kary Mullis, who developed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, further advancing genetic research. Their findings have paved the way for innovations in genetic engineering, including the development of recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy, fundamentally altering approaches to medicine and agriculture.
