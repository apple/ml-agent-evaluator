Larry Page is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur best known as one of the co-founders of Google, which he established with Sergey Brin in September 1998 while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Page played a pivotal role in developing the PageRank algorithm, which revolutionized search engine technology by ranking web pages based on their relevance and importance. Under his leadership, Google grew rapidly, going public in August 2004 with an initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at $23 billion. In 2015, Page became the CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, as part of a corporate restructuring that aimed to diversify its business ventures beyond search and advertising. As of October 2023, Page's net worth is estimated to be around $100 billion, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.
