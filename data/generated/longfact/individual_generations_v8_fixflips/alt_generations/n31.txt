Teslerâ€™s Law of the Conservation of Complexity, formulated by computer scientist Larry Tesler in the 1980s, posits that "any application that is easier to use is more complex to build." This principle suggests that the complexity inherent in a system must be managed and cannot simply be eliminated; it must be transferred elsewhere. For example, when Apple developed the user-friendly Macintosh in 1984, the complexity of its graphical user interface was hidden from users but required sophisticated programming and design efforts behind the scenes. Similarly, the rise of smartphones, particularly the iPhone launched in 2007, simplified user interactions while necessitating complex hardware and software engineering. Ultimately, Tesler's Law highlights the trade-off between user experience and the underlying complexity of technology, emphasizing that ease of use often comes at the cost of increased development challenges.
