The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, as a response to the mass exodus of East Germans to West Berlin, which had reached approximately 2.7 million people since the end of World War II. The East German government, led by Walter Ulbricht, sought to stem this flow and solidify its control over East Germany. In the early hours of that Sunday morning, East German soldiers and police began erecting barbed wire barriers along the border, which would later evolve into a concrete wall. 

By the end of the day, the initial barrier had been established, effectively sealing off West Berlin from East Berlin and the surrounding East German territory. The construction was met with mixed reactions; while many East Germans were angered, some West Berliners expressed relief at the end of the chaos caused by the mass migrations. The wall was officially referred to as the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart" by the East German government, framing it as a necessary measure against Western aggression. Over the following months, the wall was fortified with concrete blocks, guard towers, and a no-man's land, which would later become known as the "death strip." The Berlin Wall would stand for 28 years, becoming a powerful symbol of the Cold War and the division between East and West.
