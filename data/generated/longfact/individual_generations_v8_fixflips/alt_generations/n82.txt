Hippocrates, often referred to as the "Father of Medicine," was a Greek physician who lived during the Classical period, around 460 to 370 BCE, on the island of Kos. He is best known for the Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of texts that laid the foundations for medical ethics and practice, including the famous Hippocratic Oath, which emphasizes principles such as confidentiality and non-maleficence. Hippocrates advanced the understanding of diseases, proposing that they were caused by natural factors rather than supernatural ones, and he emphasized the importance of clinical observation and diagnosis. His teachings influenced many notable figures in medicine, including Galen and Avicenna, and his methods are still reflected in modern medical practices. The Hippocratic School of Medicine, which he founded, became a significant center for medical learning in ancient Greece, particularly in cities like Kos and later in places like Alexandria.
