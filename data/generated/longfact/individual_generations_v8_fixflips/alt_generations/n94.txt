The ALS Association's "Ice Bucket Challenge," which gained immense popularity in the summer of 2014, was a viral fundraising campaign aimed at raising awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Participants would dump a bucket of ice water over their heads, film the act, and then challenge others to do the same within 24 hours, often donating to the ALS Association in the process. High-profile figures such as former President George W. Bush, celebrities like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, and athletes like LeBron James participated, significantly amplifying the campaign's reach. By the end of August 2014, the ALS Association reported raising over $115 million, a staggering increase from the $2.8 million raised during the same period in 2013. The campaign's success was further fueled by social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, where videos went viral, creating a global phenomenon that engaged millions of participants across various countries.
