The Palace of Versailles, located about 12 miles southwest of Paris, was originally a hunting lodge for King Louis XIII before being transformed into a grand palace by his son, King Louis XIV, starting in 1661. The palace is renowned for its opulent architecture, including the Hall of Mirrors, which features 357 mirrors and reflects the gardens designed by landscape architect André Le Nôtre. Versailles served as the royal residence until the French Revolution, when King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were forced to leave in 1789. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I, was signed in the Hall of Mirrors on June 28, 1919, marking a significant historical event. Today, the palace is a UNESCO World Heritage site, attracting millions of visitors annually who come to admire its art, gardens, and historical significance.
