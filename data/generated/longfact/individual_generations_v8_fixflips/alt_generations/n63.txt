The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a research facility located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, USA, which began operations in 2006. It produces neutrons through a process called spallation, where protons from a linear accelerator are directed onto a target made of mercury, generating neutrons for scientific experiments. The facility is equipped with multiple neutron scattering instruments, such as the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer (HFBS) and the Wide Angle Neutron Diffractometer (WAND), enabling researchers to study materials at the atomic level. SNS has been pivotal in various fields, including materials science, biology, and chemistry, contributing to significant discoveries, such as advancements in battery technology and drug development. The facility is managed by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) and has hosted thousands of researchers from around the world, fostering collaboration and innovation in neutron science.
