In April 2017, PepsiCo faced significant backlash for its controversial advertisement featuring Kendall Jenner, which was criticized for trivializing social justice movements. In response, the company's public relations team quickly issued a statement acknowledging the misstep, emphasizing that the ad was intended to promote unity and peace. PepsiCo's Chief Marketing Officer, Brad Jakeman, later expressed regret over the ad, stating that they "missed the mark" and did not intend to offend anyone. The company ultimately pulled the ad within 24 hours of its release, and Jenner herself took to social media to express her disappointment with the outcome. Additionally, PepsiCo committed to engaging more deeply with diverse communities to ensure future campaigns would be more sensitive and inclusive.
