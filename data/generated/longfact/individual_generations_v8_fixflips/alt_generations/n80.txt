Mount Sinai, known as Har Sinai in Hebrew, is a pivotal location in Judaism where, according to the Torah, Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. This event is traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE, during the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, specifically in the book of Exodus (Exodus 19-20). The mountain is described as being enveloped in smoke and fire, with the sound of a trumpet, creating a dramatic atmosphere for the revelation (Exodus 19:18-19). The Israelites camped at the base of Mount Sinai for nearly a year, during which they received various laws and instructions, culminating in the establishment of the covenant between God and the people (Exodus 24:18). Mount Sinai is often identified with Jebel Musa in present-day Egypt, and it remains a symbol of divine law and moral guidance in Jewish tradition.
