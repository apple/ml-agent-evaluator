The Great Wall of China, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was constructed over several dynasties, with its most significant sections built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall stretches approximately 13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers) across northern China, incorporating various materials such as earth, wood, bricks, and stone, depending on the local resources available. The construction began as early as the 7th century BC, with earlier walls built by states like Qi and Yan, but the most famous sections were erected under the Ming Emperor Yongle, who reigned from 1402 to 1424. 

The wall was designed not only as a defensive structure but also as a means of border control, facilitating trade and immigration along the Silk Road. Notable features include watchtowers and beacon towers, which were used for communication and surveillance; some of these towers are spaced about every 1,000 feet (300 meters). The labor force consisted of soldiers, peasants, and prisoners, with estimates suggesting that millions of workers contributed to its construction over the centuries. The wall's construction was often perilous, with many workers losing their lives, leading to the belief that some sections are haunted by their spirits. Today, popular sections like Badaling and Mutianyu attract millions of tourists, showcasing the wall's historical significance and architectural grandeur.
