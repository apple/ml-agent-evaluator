Deep Blue was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM, notable for its historic matches against world chess champion Garry Kasparov. The most significant event occurred in May 1997, when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a six-game match, winning 2 games to 1, with 3 draws, marking the first time a reigning world champion lost a match to a computer under standard chess tournament conditions. Deep Blue was an evolution of an earlier system called Deep Thought, and it utilized advanced algorithms and massive parallel processing capabilities, evaluating up to 200 million positions per second. The match took place in New York City, specifically at the Equitable Center, and garnered worldwide media attention, symbolizing a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and human intellect. Following this victory, Deep Blue was retired, but its legacy continues to influence the development of AI in various fields.
