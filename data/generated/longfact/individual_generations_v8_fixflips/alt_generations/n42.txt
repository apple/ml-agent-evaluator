XGBoost, or Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful machine learning algorithm developed by Tianqi Chen in 2016, designed for speed and performance in supervised learning tasks. It implements gradient boosting, which combines the predictions of multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. XGBoost gained significant popularity in data science competitions, notably winning the Kaggle competition for the "Otto Group Product Classification Challenge" in 2015. The algorithm is particularly effective for structured/tabular data and has been widely used in various applications, including credit scoring and customer churn prediction. Its efficiency is attributed to features like parallel processing, regularization, and handling of missing values, making it a go-to choice for many data scientists and practitioners.
