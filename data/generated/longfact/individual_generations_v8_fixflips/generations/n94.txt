The ALS Association's "Ice Bucket Challenge," which gained traction in the summer of 2014, became a viral sensation as participants dumped buckets of ice water over their heads to raise awareness and funds for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The campaign was notably propelled by celebrities like Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, and Justin Bieber, who participated and challenged others, amplifying its reach across social media platforms. By the end of August 2014, the ALS Association reported raising over $115 million, a staggering increase from the $2.8 million raised during the same period in 2013. The challenge's viral nature was further fueled by the use of hashtags like #IceBucketChallenge and #StrikeOutALS, which encouraged widespread sharing and participation. The campaign culminated in a significant boost in public awareness about ALS, with millions of videos shared globally, showcasing the power of social media in driving charitable initiatives.
