Hippocrates, often referred to as the "Father of Medicine," was an ancient Greek physician who lived around 460 to 370 BCE on the island of Kos. He is best known for the Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of texts that laid the foundations for medical ethics and practice, including the famous Hippocratic Oath, which emphasizes principles such as confidentiality and non-maleficence. Hippocrates is credited with shifting the understanding of disease from a supernatural to a naturalistic perspective, advocating that illnesses were caused by environmental factors, diet, and lifestyle rather than divine punishment. His teachings influenced notable figures in medicine, including Galen and Avicenna, and established practices that are still relevant in modern medicine. The Hippocratic School of Medicine, which he founded, became a significant center for medical learning in ancient Greece, particularly in cities like Kos and later in places like Alexandria.
