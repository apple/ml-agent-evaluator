Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at 6:01 PM in Memphis, Tennessee. He was staying at the Lorraine Motel, where he was preparing to lead a march in support of striking sanitation workers. The assassin, James Earl Ray, fired a single shot from a nearby boarding house, striking King in the neck. King was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital but was pronounced dead at 7:05 PM. His assassination sparked riots in over 100 cities across the United States, leading to widespread unrest and protests. The FBI launched a manhunt for Ray, who was captured two months later at London Heathrow Airport. Ray was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 99 years in prison. King's death marked a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement, leading to increased activism and the eventual passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968.
