Tesler's Law of the Conservation of Complexity, formulated by computer scientist Larry Tesler in the 1980s, posits that "any application that is not simple enough will require the user to deal with complexity elsewhere." This principle suggests that complexity cannot be eliminated; it can only be shifted from one part of a system to another. For example, in software design, if a program is made simpler for the user, the underlying code may become more complex to accommodate that simplicity, as seen in user-friendly applications like Apple's early Macintosh interface, which prioritized ease of use. Tesler's work at Xerox PARC and later at Apple highlighted the balance between user experience and technical complexity, influencing the design of products like the Newton and the iPhone. Ultimately, this law serves as a reminder for designers and engineers to be mindful of where complexity resides in their systems and how it impacts user interaction.
