The Herschel Space Observatory was a space telescope launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) on May 14, 2009, as part of the Cosmic Vision program. Named after the astronomer William Herschel, who discovered infrared radiation, the observatory was designed to observe the universe in the far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, with a primary mirror measuring 3.5 meters in diameter, making it the largest space telescope ever launched at that time. Herschel's scientific mission included studying the formation of stars and galaxies, the lifecycle of interstellar matter, and the properties of distant galaxies, contributing significantly to our understanding of the early universe. The observatory operated until April 29, 2013, when it was decommissioned after running out of coolant for its instruments. Throughout its mission, Herschel made groundbreaking discoveries, including the detection of water vapor in distant galaxies and the mapping of the Milky Way's dust and gas.
