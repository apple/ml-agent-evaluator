Roald Hoffmann is a Polish-American chemist born on July 18, 1937, in Złoczów, Poland, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981, sharing it with Kenichi Fukui for their work on the theory of chemical reactions. Hoffmann is renowned for his contributions to computational chemistry, particularly in the development of the "Hoffmann rules," which help predict the outcomes of chemical reactions based on molecular orbital theory. He has also made significant contributions to the understanding of the electronic structure of molecules and materials, including his work on the "extended Hückel method." Hoffmann has held academic positions at institutions such as Cornell University, where he has influenced generations of chemists through both research and teaching. In addition to his scientific work, he is an accomplished author and has written extensively on the intersection of science and the arts, reflecting his belief in the importance of creativity in scientific inquiry.
