The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) was established in 1994 as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework during the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. It sets minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) across member countries, covering areas such as copyright, trademarks, and patents. For instance, TRIPS mandates that patents must be granted for a minimum of 20 years, which has significant implications for pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Merck, particularly in developing countries where access to medicines can be affected. The agreement has faced criticism, notably during the 2001 Doha Declaration, where countries like Brazil and India advocated for more flexible patent rules to enhance access to essential medicines. As of October 2023, TRIPS remains a pivotal element in global trade discussions, influencing debates on innovation, public health, and economic development.
