The Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus outbreak first emerged in China in March 2013, with the first reported human case occurring on March 31, when a 38-year-old man from Jiangsu Province was hospitalized. By April 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed multiple cases, leading to heightened surveillance and public health measures across affected regions. The outbreak was primarily linked to live poultry markets, with the virus detected in birds, particularly in eastern China, including cities like Shanghai and Zhejiang. By the end of 2017, there were over 1,500 reported cases and at least 600 deaths attributed to H7N9, highlighting its severity and the challenges in controlling its spread. The outbreak prompted significant international concern and research efforts to understand the virus's transmission and potential for pandemic spread.
