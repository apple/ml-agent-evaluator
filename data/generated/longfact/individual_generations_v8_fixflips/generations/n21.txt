The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, space-based observatory developed through a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), launched on December 25, 2021. It is designed to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths, allowing it to study the formation of stars and galaxies, the atmospheres of exoplanets, and the early universe, with a primary mirror measuring 6.5 meters in diameter. The telescope's first images were released on July 12, 2022, showcasing its capabilities with stunning views of the Carina Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, and the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. Key figures in its development include Dr. John Mather, a Nobel laureate and senior project scientist, and Dr. Eric Smith, the program director for the JWST at NASA. JWST operates from a location near the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where it maintains a stable position to observe the cosmos.
