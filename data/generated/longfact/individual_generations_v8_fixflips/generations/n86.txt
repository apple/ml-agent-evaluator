Loving v. Virginia was a landmark Supreme Court case decided on June 12, 1967, that invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The case involved Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, who were arrested in 1958 for marrying in Washington, D.C., and returning to their home in Caroline County, Virginia, where interracial marriage was illegal. The Lovings were sentenced to a year in prison, which was suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia for 25 years. They challenged the constitutionality of Virginia's anti-miscegenation statute, and the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that such laws violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision effectively struck down laws against interracial marriage in 16 states, marking a significant victory for the civil rights movement.
