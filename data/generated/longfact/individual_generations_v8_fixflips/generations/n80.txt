Mount Sinai, known as Har Sinai in Hebrew, is a pivotal location in Judaism where, according to the Torah, Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. This event is traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE and is described in the Book of Exodus, specifically Exodus 19-20, where the Israelites camped at the mountain after their exodus from Egypt. The mountain is often associated with the giving of the Law, which occurred on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of Sivan, celebrated as the festival of Shavuot. The biblical narrative describes a dramatic scene with thunder, lightning, and the sound of a shofar, emphasizing the divine presence (Exodus 19:16-19). Mount Sinai's exact location remains a subject of debate, with various proposed sites in the Sinai Peninsula, but it is universally recognized as a symbol of covenant and divine revelation in Jewish tradition.
