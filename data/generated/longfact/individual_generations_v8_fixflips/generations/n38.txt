The National Instruments CompactRIO (cRIO) controller is a versatile platform widely used in control systems and data acquisition applications due to its modular architecture and real-time capabilities. It combines a real-time processor with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), allowing for high-speed data processing and control, making it ideal for applications such as industrial automation, robotics, and test systems. For instance, in 2019, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, utilized cRIO to develop a robotic system for autonomous navigation in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time decision-making. Additionally, the CompactRIO is often employed in harsh environments, such as oil and gas exploration, where its rugged design and ability to interface with various sensors and actuators are crucial. Overall, the cRIO's flexibility and reliability have made it a preferred choice for engineers and researchers in diverse fields, including aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy.
