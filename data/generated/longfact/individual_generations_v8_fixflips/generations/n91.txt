The Flint Water Crisis, which began in April 2014, involved the unethical decision to switch Flint, Michigan's water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money, leading to widespread lead contamination. Key figures in this controversy included then-Governor Rick Snyder, who faced criticism for his administration's neglect of public health concerns, and former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, who oversaw the switch and ignored warnings about water quality. Residents reported foul-smelling, discolored water, and elevated lead levels were confirmed in children, with over 9,000 children exposed to lead by 2015. The crisis highlighted systemic issues of environmental racism, as the predominantly African American population of Flint suffered disproportionately from the negligence of state officials. In 2016, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a report stating that the crisis was a result of systemic racism and a failure of government accountability, leading to ongoing legal battles and calls for justice.
