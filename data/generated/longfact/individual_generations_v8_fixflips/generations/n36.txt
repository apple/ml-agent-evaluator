Kary Mullis was an American biochemist born on December 28, 1944, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for inventing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1983. PCR revolutionized DNA research by allowing scientists to amplify specific DNA sequences exponentially, enabling the analysis of minute quantities of DNA, which was previously a significant limitation in molecular biology. This technique has been pivotal in various applications, including forensic science, where it has been used to solve criminal cases, such as the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995, and in medical diagnostics, such as detecting viral infections like HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Mullis's invention also facilitated advancements in genetic research, including the Human Genome Project, which began in 1990 and was completed in 2003, mapping the entire human genome. His work has had a lasting impact on fields ranging from genetics to medicine, making PCR a cornerstone technique in laboratories worldwide.
