Peter L. Berger (1929-2017) was an influential Austrian-American sociologist known for his work in the sociology of religion and the social construction of reality. He co-authored the seminal book "The Social Construction of Reality" (1966) with Thomas Luckmann, which introduced the concept that reality is shaped through social interactions and shared understandings. Berger also wrote extensively on the role of religion in modern society, notably in works like "The Sacred Canopy" (1967), where he argued that religion provides a framework for meaning in a secular world. He served as a professor at institutions such as Boston University and The New School for Social Research, influencing generations of sociologists. Throughout his career, Berger received numerous accolades, including the prestigious "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the American Sociological Association in 2001.
