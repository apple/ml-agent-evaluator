The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, as a response to the mass emigration of East Germans to West Berlin, which had become a symbol of freedom during the Cold War. The East German government, led by Walter Ulbricht, sought to stem the tide of defections, which had reached approximately 2.5 million people since the end of World War II. On that day, soldiers and workers erected barbed wire barriers along the border, which quickly evolved into a concrete wall. 

By August 14, 1961, the wall was fortified with guard towers and a "death strip" designed to deter escape attempts. The construction was met with international condemnation, particularly from the United States, where President John F. Kennedy expressed his disapproval, stating that the wall was a "denial of human rights." Over the following months, the wall was completed, measuring about 96 miles in length, effectively dividing East and West Berlin. 

The wall became a physical manifestation of the Iron Curtain, symbolizing the ideological divide between the communist East and the democratic West. Notably, the first person to be killed trying to cross the wall was Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old East German, who was shot on August 17, 1962, highlighting the deadly consequences of the division. The Berlin Wall would stand until its fall on November 9, 1989, marking a significant turning point in the Cold War.
