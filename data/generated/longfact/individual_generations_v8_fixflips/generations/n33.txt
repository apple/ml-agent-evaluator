The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to major corporate scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom, to oversee the audits of public companies. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the PCAOB's primary mission is to protect investors by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. As of 2023, the PCAOB is led by Chair Erica Williams, who was appointed in 2021, and it has implemented various standards and rules to enhance audit quality. The Board conducts inspections of registered public accounting firms, with over 1,800 firms registered as of 2023, and it publishes annual reports detailing its findings and recommendations. Notably, the PCAOB has also expanded its focus to include audits of foreign companies listed in the U.S., emphasizing the importance of compliance with U.S. auditing standards.
