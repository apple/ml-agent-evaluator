The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066, near Hastings in East Sussex, England. It was fought between the Norman-French army led by Duke William of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror, and the English army commanded by King Harold II. The battle was a pivotal moment in the Norman Conquest of England, with Harold's forces estimated at around 7,000 men facing William's approximately 10,000 troops. The conflict began around 9 AM and lasted until dusk, culminating in Harold's death, famously depicted with an arrow in his eye, which led to the collapse of English resistance. The victory allowed William to claim the English throne, significantly altering the course of English history and leading to the establishment of Norman rule.
