The Charter of the United Nations was signed on June 26, 1945, in San Francisco, California, by representatives of 50 countries, including notable figures like U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov. It came into force on October 24, 1945, which is now celebrated annually as United Nations Day. The Charter establishes the UN's purposes, principles, and structure, including the creation of six main organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council. It emphasizes the promotion of peace, security, human rights, and social progress, reflecting the aftermath of World War II and the desire to prevent future conflicts. The document has been amended several times, with significant changes made in 1965 to expand the membership of the Security Council and in 1973 to address issues of decolonization.
