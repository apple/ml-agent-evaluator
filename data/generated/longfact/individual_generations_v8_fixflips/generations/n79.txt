The Louvre Museum, located in Paris, France, is one of the world's largest and most visited art museums, attracting approximately 9.6 million visitors in 2019. Originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century under King Philip II, it was transformed into a royal palace and opened as a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution. The museum houses over 380,000 objects, including iconic works such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," which measures 77 cm Ã— 53 cm, and the ancient Greek statue "Venus de Milo," dating back to around 100 BC. The Louvre's glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei and inaugurated in 1989, has become a symbol of the museum and a notable feature of the Paris skyline. With its vast collection spanning from ancient civilizations to the 19th century, the Louvre is a cultural treasure trove that reflects the history of art and humanity.
