In April 2017, PepsiCo faced significant backlash for its controversial advertisement featuring Kendall Jenner, which was criticized for trivializing social justice movements. In response, the company's public relations team quickly issued a statement acknowledging the misstep, emphasizing that the ad was intended to promote unity and peace. PepsiCo's Chief Marketing Officer, Brad Jakeman, later expressed regret over the ad, stating that they had "missed the mark." The company ultimately pulled the ad within 24 hours of its release and issued an apology, stating, "We are sorry that we put together a campaign that was perceived to be insensitive." This swift action aimed to mitigate the negative impact on the brand and restore public trust.
