The Apollo 11 mission, launched on July 16, 1969, was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins aboard. The Lunar Module, named "Eagle," successfully touched down on the Moon's surface on July 20, 1969, at 2:56 UTC in the Sea of Tranquility. Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the lunar surface, famously declaring, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," at 2:56 UTC. Buzz Aldrin joined him shortly after, and together they spent about 2.5 hours outside the module, conducting experiments and collecting lunar samples. The mission concluded with a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, at 16:50 UTC, marking a significant achievement in space exploration and the Space Race.
