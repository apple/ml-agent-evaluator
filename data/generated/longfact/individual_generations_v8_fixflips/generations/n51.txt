The Parmalat financial scandal, which erupted in December 2003, involved the Italian dairy and food company Parmalat S.p.A., revealing a massive accounting fraud that amounted to approximately €14 billion (around $20 billion at the time). The scandal was primarily orchestrated by Parmalat's founder and CEO, Calisto Tanzi, who misled investors and regulators about the company's financial health by creating fictitious assets and inflating revenues. The fraud came to light when auditors from Grant Thornton discovered a €4 billion hole in Parmalat's accounts, leading to the company's bankruptcy filing on December 24, 2003, in a Milan court. The scandal also implicated several banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup, which were accused of facilitating the fraud through complex financial instruments. Ultimately, Tanzi was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2008, while the fallout from the scandal led to significant regulatory changes in Italy and beyond, aimed at improving corporate governance and financial transparency.
