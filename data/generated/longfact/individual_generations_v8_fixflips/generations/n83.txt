The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching over 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) and comprising approximately 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 and is home to an incredible diversity of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of coral, and various marine mammals such as the dugong and the endangered green sea turtle. The reef has faced significant threats from climate change, with coral bleaching events, notably in 1998 and 2016, leading to substantial loss of coral coverâ€”up to 50% in some areas. Conservation efforts, such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's management plans, aim to protect this vital ecosystem, which contributes approximately AUD 6.4 billion annually to the Australian economy through tourism and fishing. Notable figures in reef conservation include Dr. Terry Hughes, a prominent coral reef scientist, who has been instrumental in raising awareness about the impacts of climate change on the reef.
