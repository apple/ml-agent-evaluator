The Enron scandal, which came to light in late 2001, involved the Houston-based energy company Enron Corporation, which was once one of the largest companies in the United States. Key figures in the scandal included CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who promoted the use of complex financial instruments, and Chairman Kenneth Lay, who misled investors about the company's financial health. Enron used accounting practices like mark-to-market accounting to inflate profits, leading to a reported $101 billion in revenue in 2000, while hiding significant debts through off-balance-sheet partnerships. The scandal unraveled in October 2001 when Enron announced it was restating its earnings, leading to a plummet in stock prices from around $90 to less than $1 by December. 

The fallout resulted in the bankruptcy of Enron on December 2, 2001, which was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time, affecting thousands of employees and investors. The scandal also implicated Arthur Andersen, one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world, which was found guilty of obstructing justice for shredding Enron-related documents. The controversy led to significant regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, aimed at increasing transparency in financial reporting. Ultimately, the Enron scandal highlighted severe ethical lapses in corporate governance and accounting practices, leaving a lasting impact on the business landscape.
