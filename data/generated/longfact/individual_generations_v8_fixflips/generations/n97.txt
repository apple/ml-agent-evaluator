IKEA's "Where Life Happens" advertising campaign, launched in 2018, focuses on the everyday moments that occur in homes, emphasizing the importance of creating functional and inviting living spaces. The campaign features relatable scenarios, such as family gatherings, home offices, and cozy evenings, showcasing how IKEA products can enhance these experiences. For instance, the campaign includes a series of short films that depict diverse families and individuals navigating life's challenges, highlighting the emotional connection people have with their homes. Additionally, IKEA utilized social media platforms to engage audiences, encouraging them to share their own stories and experiences using the hashtag #WhereLifeHappens. This strategy not only humanizes the brand but also reinforces IKEA's commitment to understanding and improving the lives of its customers through thoughtful design.
