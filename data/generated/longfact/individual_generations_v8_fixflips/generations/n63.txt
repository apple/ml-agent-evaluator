The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a premier research facility located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, USA, which began operations in 2006. It produces neutrons through a process called spallation, where protons from a linear accelerator collide with a target material, typically mercury, generating neutrons for scientific experiments. The facility is equipped with multiple neutron scattering instruments, including the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and various beamlines, enabling research in materials science, biology, and physics. Notable figures associated with SNS include Dr. David L. Johnson, who has played a significant role in its development and operation. Since its inception, SNS has hosted thousands of researchers from around the world, contributing to advancements in fields such as energy storage, drug development, and nanotechnology.
