Kary Mullis was an American biochemist born on December 28, 1944, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for inventing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1983. PCR revolutionized DNA research by allowing scientists to amplify specific DNA sequences exponentially, enabling the analysis of minute quantities of DNA, which was crucial for applications in genetics, forensics, and medical diagnostics. For example, in the early 1990s, PCR was instrumental in the identification of the genetic basis of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and in the development of techniques for DNA fingerprinting, which played a pivotal role in criminal investigations. The technology has also been fundamental in the Human Genome Project, which began in 1990 and aimed to map all human genes, ultimately leading to significant advancements in personalized medicine. Mullis's invention has since become a cornerstone of molecular biology, with millions of PCR tests performed daily, especially highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic for viral detection.
