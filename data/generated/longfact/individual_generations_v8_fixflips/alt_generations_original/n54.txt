The Swiss National Bank (SNB), headquartered in Bern and Zurich, is responsible for Switzerland's monetary policy, aiming to ensure price stability and support the country's economic policy. It manages the Swiss franc's value and intervenes in foreign exchange markets when necessary, such as its significant interventions in 2011 to curb the franc's appreciation against the euro. The SNB also oversees the country's financial system's stability, conducting regular assessments and stress tests, with its governing board led by President Thomas Jordan since 2012. In 2020, the SNB reported a profit of CHF 21.3 billion, largely due to its foreign currency investments, which are crucial for maintaining liquidity in the Swiss economy. Additionally, the SNB plays a vital role in the global financial system, holding substantial foreign currency reserves, which amounted to CHF 1 trillion as of mid-2023.
