The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner, first awarded in 1893. Named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, the trophy has a rich history, with the Montreal Canadiens holding the record for the most championships, having won it 24 times, the last being in 1993. The Cup is known for its unique design, featuring a silver bowl atop a series of engraved rings that list the names of winning players and teams. Notable moments include the 2010 Chicago Blackhawks ending a 49-year championship drought and the 2019 St. Louis Blues winning their first Cup in franchise history. The trophy is traditionally awarded in June, with the final series often referred to as the Stanley Cup Final, held in various arenas across North America, including the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York City and the Bell Centre in Montreal.
