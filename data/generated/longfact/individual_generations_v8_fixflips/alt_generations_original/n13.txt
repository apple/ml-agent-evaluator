The controversy surrounding Uber's sexual harassment allegations gained significant attention in 2017 when former engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing her experiences of sexual harassment at the company. In her post, Fowler described how her complaints about inappropriate advances from a manager were dismissed by HR, who claimed that the manager was a "high performer." This revelation led to a broader investigation into Uber's workplace culture, which was characterized by a toxic environment and systemic issues regarding gender discrimination. 

The fallout from Fowler's allegations prompted a company-wide investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, resulting in the recommendation of 47 changes to Uber's policies. In June 2017, Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick resigned amid mounting pressure and criticism over the company's culture and leadership. The controversy also led to the departure of several high-profile executives, including Chief Business Officer Emil Michael and President Jeff Jones. 

In total, the investigation uncovered over 200 claims of sexual harassment and discrimination, highlighting a pervasive issue within the company. The scandal not only damaged Uber's reputation but also sparked a wider conversation about sexism in Silicon Valley and the tech industry as a whole. Ultimately, the events surrounding Uber's sexual harassment allegations served as a catalyst for change, prompting many companies to reevaluate their workplace cultures and policies.
