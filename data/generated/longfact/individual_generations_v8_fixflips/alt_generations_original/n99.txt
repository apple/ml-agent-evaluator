Google's "Year in Search" marketing strategy leverages data analytics to highlight the most popular search trends and topics of the year, creating a compelling narrative around collective human curiosity and behavior. For instance, in 2020, the campaign emphasized themes like the COVID-19 pandemic, with searches for "how to make hand sanitizer" surging by 4,000%, reflecting the global shift in priorities. The campaign often features a video recap, showcasing significant events such as the Black Lives Matter protests and the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed to 2021. By using emotional storytelling and relatable content, Google connects with audiences on a personal level, fostering brand loyalty and engagement. The annual release, typically in December, serves as both a reflection of societal trends and a powerful marketing tool that reinforces Google's role as an essential information resource.
