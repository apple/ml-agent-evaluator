The Louvre Museum, located in Paris, France, is one of the world's largest and most visited art museums, attracting approximately 9.6 million visitors in 2019. Originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century under King Philip II, it was transformed into a royal palace and finally opened as a public museum on August 10, 1793, during the French Revolution. The museum houses over 380,000 objects, including iconic works such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," which measures 77 cm Ã— 53 cm, and the ancient Greek statue "Venus de Milo," dating back to around 100 BC. The Louvre's glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei, was inaugurated in 1989 and has become a symbol of the museum. With a total area of 72,735 square meters dedicated to exhibitions, the Louvre is not only a cultural landmark but also a significant historical site in Paris.
