The Apollo 13 mission, launched on April 11, 1970, aimed to land on the Moon but faced a critical failure when an oxygen tank exploded two days into the flight, on April 13, 1970, at 55 hours and 55 minutes into the mission. The crew, consisting of Commander James Lovell, Command Module Pilot John Swigert, and Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, had to abort their lunar landing plans and instead focus on returning safely to Earth. The explosion caused a loss of electrical power and a significant reduction in life support systems, prompting the team at NASA's Mission Control in Houston, Texas, led by Flight Director Gene Kranz, to devise a series of innovative solutions to conserve resources. The crew used the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" to provide life support and propulsion, successfully executing a critical engine burn on April 17, 1970, to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Apollo 13 splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean on April 17, 1970, at 1:07 PM EDT, marking a remarkable example of teamwork and ingenuity in overcoming adversity.
