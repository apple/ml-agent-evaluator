Dr. Virginia Apgar was an American obstetrical anesthesiologist born on June 7, 1909, in Westfield, New Jersey. She is best known for developing the Apgar Score in 1952, a quick assessment tool used to evaluate the health of newborns immediately after birth, which assesses five criteria: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace response, Activity, and Respiration. Apgar graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933 and became the first female anesthesiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Throughout her career, she advocated for the importance of maternal and infant health, serving as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and later at the University of Virginia. Dr. Apgar passed away on August 7, 1974, but her legacy continues through the widespread use of the Apgar Score, which has saved countless lives by facilitating timely medical interventions for newborns.
