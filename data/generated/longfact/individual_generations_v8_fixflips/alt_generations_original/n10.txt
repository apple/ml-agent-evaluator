Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at 6:01 PM in Memphis, Tennessee. He was staying at the Lorraine Motel, where he was preparing to lead a march in support of striking sanitation workers. As he stood on the balcony, a single shot rang out, fired from a nearby boarding house by James Earl Ray, a fugitive who had been on the run since escaping from prison. King was struck in the neck and later died at St. Joseph's Hospital at 7:05 PM. His assassination sparked riots in over 100 cities across the United States, resulting in 39 deaths and thousands of injuries. The FBI launched a massive manhunt for Ray, who was captured two months later at London Heathrow Airport. Ray was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 99 years in prison, although he later recanted his confession, claiming he was framed. King's death marked a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement, leading to increased activism and the eventual passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968.
