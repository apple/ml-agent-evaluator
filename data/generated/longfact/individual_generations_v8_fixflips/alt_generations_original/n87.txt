The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a major astronomical survey that began in 2000, aimed at mapping the universe in unprecedented detail. It utilizes a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope located at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, and has produced detailed images and spectra of millions of celestial objects. The survey has released several data releases, with Data Release 16 (DR16) occurring in July 2020, which included data on over 3 million astronomical objects. Key figures in the project include astronomers like David Hogg and Robert Lupton, who have contributed significantly to its development and data analysis. SDSS has played a crucial role in various discoveries, including the mapping of the large-scale structure of the universe and the identification of distant quasars and galaxies.
