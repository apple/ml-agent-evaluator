Bloody Sunday occurred on January 30, 1972, in Derry, Northern Ireland, during a civil rights march organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. The march aimed to protest against the internment of suspected Irish republicans without trial. Approximately 10,000 people participated, and the event began peacefully at around 2:00 PM. As the march progressed towards the city center, British soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were deployed to contain the crowd. 

Around 3:00 PM, tensions escalated when soldiers opened fire on the marchers, resulting in the deaths of 14 unarmed civilians, including 17-year-old Jackie Duddy and 31-year-old Patrick Doherty. Many others were injured, with estimates of around 200 rounds fired by the soldiers. The incident sparked outrage and intensified the conflict known as "The Troubles," leading to increased support for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In 2010, the Saville Inquiry concluded that the killings were unjustified, leading to a formal apology from then-British Prime Minister David Cameron.
