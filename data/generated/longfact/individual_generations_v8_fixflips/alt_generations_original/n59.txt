Sheryl Sandberg is an American technology executive, author, and philanthropist, best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook, a position she held from March 2008 until her departure in June 2022. Under her leadership, Facebook's revenue grew significantly, with the company reporting over $117 billion in revenue for 2021, largely driven by advertising. Sandberg played a crucial role in scaling the company's operations and developing its advertising model, which included the introduction of targeted ads based on user data. She is also the author of the bestselling book "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead," published in 2013, which sparked discussions about women's leadership and workplace equality. Sandberg's tenure at Facebook was marked by both growth and controversy, particularly regarding issues of privacy and misinformation, especially during events like the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
