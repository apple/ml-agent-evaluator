The Ghost Orchid, scientifically known as *Dendrophylax lindenii*, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the swamps of Florida and Cuba. It gained fame in the late 20th century, particularly after the 2007 book "The Orchid Thief" by Susan Orlean, which highlighted the illegal poaching of this flower and its allure among collectors. The Ghost Orchid is known for its striking, white, and green flowers that appear to float in the air, often blooming from June to August. One of the most notable locations to find this orchid is the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park in Florida, where it was famously rediscovered in 2006 by orchid enthusiast and conservationist, Dr. John P. McCarty. The Ghost Orchid has become a symbol of conservation efforts, with its population threatened by habitat loss and illegal collection, prompting initiatives to protect its natural habitat.
