Norman Foster, through his firm Foster + Partners, played a pivotal role in the design of Apple Campus 2, also known as Apple Park, located in Cupertino, California. The project was officially announced in 2013, with construction commencing in 2014 and completion in 2017. The campus features a distinctive circular design, often referred to as "the spaceship," and spans approximately 175 acres, accommodating around 12,000 employees. The main building, known as the Steve Jobs Theater, is a 1,000-seat auditorium that hosts product launches and events, named in honor of Apple's co-founder, Steve Jobs, who passed away in 2011. 

Foster collaborated closely with Appleâ€™s then-CEO Tim Cook and former design chief Jony Ive to create a space that emphasizes sustainability and innovation. The campus is designed to be environmentally friendly, with 80% of the site dedicated to green space, including over 9,000 trees. The project also incorporates advanced technologies, such as natural ventilation and solar panels, aiming for LEED Platinum certification. Apple Park officially opened its doors to employees in April 2017, marking a significant milestone in the company's history and architectural landscape.
