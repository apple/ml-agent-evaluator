The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal erupted in March 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had improperly harvested the personal data of approximately 87 million Facebook users without their consent. This data was collected through a personality quiz app developed by Aleksandr Kogan, which was downloaded by around 270,000 users, but also accessed the data of their friends. The scandal raised significant concerns about privacy and the ethical use of data in political campaigns, particularly in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's campaign. Key figures involved included Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, who testified before Congress on April 10, 2018, addressing the company's role in the data breach. The fallout led to widespread public outrage, resulting in calls for stricter regulations on data privacy and social media platforms. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) fined Facebook Â£500,000 for failing to protect user data. The scandal also prompted investigations by various regulatory bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. Ultimately, the incident highlighted the vulnerabilities in data privacy and the potential for misuse in influencing democratic processes.
