The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second-largest ice body in the world, covering approximately 1.7 million square kilometers and containing about 2.9 million cubic kilometers of ice. It has been a focal point of climate research, particularly since the early 2000s, when scientists like Dr. Jason Box and Dr. Marco Tedesco highlighted accelerated melting due to rising global temperatures. In 2019, a study revealed that the ice sheet lost around 600 billion tons of ice in a single year, contributing to global sea level rise. The ice sheet's melting is particularly pronounced in areas like the Jakobshavn Glacier, which has retreated significantly over the past few decades. As of 2021, projections indicated that if current trends continue, the Greenland Ice Sheet could contribute up to 7 meters to global sea levels by the end of the century.
