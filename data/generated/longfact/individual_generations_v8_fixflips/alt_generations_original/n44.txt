The America's Cup is the oldest international sporting trophy, first contested in 1851, and is awarded to the winner of a sailing regatta between yacht clubs. The competition originated when the yacht "America," representing the New York Yacht Club, won a race around the Isle of Wight, defeating the British fleet. The event has evolved over the years, with notable teams including the Oracle Team USA, which won the Cup in 2010 and 2013, and Emirates Team New Zealand, which claimed victory in 2021. The Cup is held every few years, with the next edition scheduled for 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, featuring advanced sailing technology and design. Key figures in the competition include Sir Thomas Lipton, who famously challenged for the Cup five times in the early 20th century, and Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, who played a significant role in revitalizing the event in the 21st century.
