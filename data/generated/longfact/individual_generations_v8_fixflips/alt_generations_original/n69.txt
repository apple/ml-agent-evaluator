The Dolmen of Menga is a megalithic burial site located near the town of Antequera in the province of Málaga, Spain, dating back to the Neolithic period, around 3,500 BCE. It is one of the largest dolmens in Europe, consisting of a large chamber formed by massive stone slabs, with a capstone weighing approximately 180 tons. The site is part of the Antequera Dolmens Site, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016, recognizing its significance in prehistoric architecture and culture. Archaeological studies have revealed that the dolmen was used for collective burials, and it is aligned with the nearby Peña de los Enamorados mountain, suggesting a connection to astronomical events. The Dolmen of Menga is often associated with the ancient culture of the Iberians and has been a subject of study by various archaeologists, including the notable Spanish archaeologist Manuel de Góngora in the early 20th century.
