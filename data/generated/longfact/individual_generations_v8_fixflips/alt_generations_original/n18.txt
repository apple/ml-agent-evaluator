Undertale is an indie role-playing video game created by Toby Fox, released on September 15, 2015. The game is set in the Underground, a secluded realm beneath the surface of the Earth, inhabited by monsters who were banished after a war with humans. Players control a human child named Frisk, who falls into the Underground and embarks on a journey to return to the surface. Throughout the game, players encounter various characters, including the skeleton brothers Sans and Papyrus, the determined monster Undyne, and the kind-hearted healer Alphys. 

One of the game's unique features is its combat system, which allows players to choose between fighting monsters or using non-violent options like "Act" and "Mercy," influencing the game's outcome and the fate of its characters. The game has multiple endings, including the "Pacifist" ending, where players spare all monsters, and the "Genocide" ending, where they defeat every monster they encounter. Undertale is renowned for its humor, emotional depth, and memorable soundtrack, including tracks like "Megalovania" and "Save the World." The game has garnered a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim, winning several awards and selling over 1 million copies within its first year.
