The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999, aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia during mission STS-93. Named after the Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Chandra is designed to observe X-rays emitted by high-energy regions of the universe, such as supernova remnants, black holes, and neutron stars. It operates in a highly elliptical orbit around Earth, reaching altitudes of up to 139,000 kilometers (about 86,000 miles), allowing it to avoid the interference of Earth's atmosphere. The observatory features a 1.2-meter (4-foot) diameter mirror, which is the largest X-ray mirror ever flown in space, and it has a suite of four scientific instruments that enable it to capture high-resolution images and spectra of X-ray sources. 

Chandra has made significant contributions to astrophysics, including the discovery of the first X-ray emission from a black hole in the Milky Way, known as Cygnus X-1, and the observation of the remnants of supernova SN 1987A. The observatory has also played a crucial role in studying the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters, such as the Perseus Cluster, and has provided insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. As of October 2023, Chandra has completed over 20 years of operation, with more than 1,000 scientific papers published based on its data. The mission is managed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and continues to be a vital tool for astronomers worldwide.
