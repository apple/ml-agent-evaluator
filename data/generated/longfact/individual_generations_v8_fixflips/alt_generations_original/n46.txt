The Raspberry Pi Zero is a small, low-cost single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, first released in November 2015. It features a Broadcom BCM2835 processor, 512 MB of RAM, and a mini HDMI port, making it suitable for various DIY projects and embedded applications. The original model was priced at just $5, which significantly lowered the barrier to entry for hobbyists and educators interested in computing and programming. In 2016, the Raspberry Pi Zero W was introduced, adding built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, further expanding its usability in IoT projects. The Raspberry Pi Zero has been widely adopted in the maker community, with applications ranging from retro gaming consoles to home automation systems.
