The Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus outbreak first emerged in China in March 2013, with the first reported human case occurring on March 31, when a 38-year-old man from Shanghai was hospitalized. By April 2013, the outbreak had spread to several provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, leading to a total of 135 confirmed human cases and 45 deaths by the end of the year. The virus was primarily linked to live poultry markets, prompting the Chinese government to implement measures such as culling infected birds and closing markets in affected areas. Notably, the outbreak raised global health concerns due to its potential for human-to-human transmission, although such cases were rare. The World Health Organization (WHO) monitored the situation closely, emphasizing the importance of surveillance and public health preparedness in response to the evolving threat of H7N9.
