The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, space-based observatory developed through a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), launched on December 25, 2021. It is designed to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths, allowing it to study the formation of stars and galaxies, the atmospheres of exoplanets, and the early universe. The telescope features a 6.5-meter primary mirror, composed of 18 hexagonal segments, and is equipped with advanced instruments such as the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). JWST operates from a stable location near the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where it can maintain a constant temperature and minimize interference from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Its first images were released on July 12, 2022, showcasing stunning views of cosmic phenomena, including the Carina Nebula and the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723.
