The Charter of the United Nations was signed on June 26, 1945, in San Francisco, California, by representatives of 50 countries, including notable figures like U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov. It came into force on October 24, 1945, establishing the UN's purposes and principles, which include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, and fostering social and economic development. The Charter consists of a preamble and 19 chapters, detailing the structure and functions of the UN's main organs, such as the General Assembly and the Security Council. One significant event related to the Charter was the establishment of the UN Peacekeeping Forces, which began with the deployment of troops to the Middle East in 1948 following the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Charter has been amended several times, with the most notable amendment occurring in 1965, which expanded the membership of the Security Council from 11 to 15 members.
