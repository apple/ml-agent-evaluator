The National Instruments CompactRIO (cRIO) controller is a versatile platform widely used in control systems and data acquisition due to its modular architecture and real-time capabilities. It integrates a real-time processor, FPGA, and I/O modules, allowing for high-speed data processing and control in applications such as industrial automation, robotics, and research. For example, in 2019, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, utilized cRIO to develop a robotic system for autonomous navigation in complex environments, enhancing their robotics program. Additionally, the CompactRIO has been employed in various industries, including automotive testing, where companies like Ford have used it for engine control unit (ECU) testing to ensure performance and compliance with standards. Its flexibility and scalability make it an ideal choice for projects ranging from small-scale experiments to large industrial systems, demonstrating its impact on modern engineering practices.
