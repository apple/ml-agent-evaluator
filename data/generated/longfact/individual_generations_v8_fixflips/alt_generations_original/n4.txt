The Enron scandal, which came to light in late 2001, involved the Houston-based energy company Enron Corporation, which was once one of the largest companies in the United States. Key figures in the scandal included CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who promoted the use of complex financial instruments, and Chairman Kenneth Lay, who misled investors about the company's financial health. Enron used accounting practices like mark-to-market accounting to inflate profits, leading to a reported $101 billion in revenue in 2000, despite significant debts. The scandal unraveled in October 2001 when Enron announced it was restating its earnings by nearly $600 million, leading to a plummet in stock prices from around $90 to less than $1 by December. 

The company's bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, was the largest in U.S. history at the time, resulting in thousands of employees losing their jobs and retirement savings. The fallout also implicated Arthur Andersen, one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world, which was found guilty of obstructing justice for shredding Enron-related documents. The scandal prompted widespread regulatory reforms, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, aimed at increasing transparency in financial reporting. Ultimately, the Enron scandal highlighted severe ethical lapses in corporate governance and accounting practices, leading to a loss of trust in corporate America.
