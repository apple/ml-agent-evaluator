The Leaning Tower of Pisa, officially known as the Campanile di Pisa, was inspired by Romanesque architecture, characterized by its rounded arches and sturdy pillars. Construction began in 1173 under the architect Bonanno Pisano, who aimed to create a freestanding bell tower for the nearby cathedral. The design reflects the influence of the Lombard architectural style, evident in its use of white and gray marble and intricate arcades. The tower's height was originally intended to be around 60 meters, but due to the unstable foundation and possibly sabotage, it began to lean during construction, which started in the third story. 

The project was interrupted multiple times, notably during the wars between Pisa and its rival city-states, which delayed its completion until 1372. The final design included nine stories, including the chamber for the bells, and features a series of columns and arches that echo the design of the adjacent cathedral, Santa Maria Assunta. The tower's iconic lean, which reached about 5.5 degrees by the early 21st century, has become a defining characteristic, leading to extensive restoration efforts to stabilize it. Today, the Leaning Tower of Pisa stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting around 3.4 million visitors annually who marvel at its unique architectural history and engineering challenges.
