Elon Musk co-founded Tesla, Inc. in 2003 and has served as its CEO and product architect since 2008, playing a pivotal role in the company's vision to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Under his leadership, Tesla launched several groundbreaking electric vehicles, including the Model S in 2012, the Model 3 in 2017, and the Model Y in 2020, with the Model 3 becoming the best-selling electric car globally in 2021. Musk has been instrumental in expanding Tesla's production capabilities, notably with the Gigafactory in Nevada, which began operations in 2016 and aimed to produce enough batteries to power 700,000 vehicles annually. He has also overseen significant financial growth, with Tesla's market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion in 2021, making it one of the most valuable automakers in the world. Additionally, Musk's ambitious goals include the development of the Cybertruck, unveiled in November 2019, and the ongoing expansion of Tesla's global footprint, including factories in Berlin, Paris and Texas, which are set to enhance production capacity significantly.
