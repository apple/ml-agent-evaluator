The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion, first awarded in 1893. Named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, the trophy has a rich history, with the Montreal Canadiens holding the record for the most championships, having won it 24 times, the last being in March 1993. The Cup is known for its unique design, featuring a silver bowl atop a series of engraved rings that list the names of winning players and teams. Notable events include the 2010 Chicago Blackhawks' victory, which ended a 49-year championship drought, and the 2019 St. Louis Blues' second-ever Cup win, clinched in Game 7 against the Boston Bruins on June 12. The trophy is famously taken on a tour by players, with each champion often sharing it with their hometowns, showcasing its significance in hockey culture.
