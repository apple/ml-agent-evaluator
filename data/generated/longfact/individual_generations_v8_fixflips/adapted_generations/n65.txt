The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established on April 4, 1949, with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., by 12 founding member countries, including the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations. The alliance operates on the principle of collective defense, as outlined in Article 1 of the treaty, which states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all; this was invoked for the first time after the September 11 attacks in 2001. NATO has expanded its membership over the years, with 30 member countries as of 2023, including recent additions like Montenegro (2017) and North Macedonia (2020). Key military operations include the Kosovo Force (KFOR) established in 1999 and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2001 to March 2014. The organization has also held numerous summits, such as the 2021 Brussels Peace Summit, where leaders discussed security challenges and the future of the alliance in a changing geopolitical landscape.
