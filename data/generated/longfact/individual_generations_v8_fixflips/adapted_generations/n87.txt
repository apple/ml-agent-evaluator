The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a major astronomical survey that began in 2000, aimed at mapping the universe in unprecedented detail. It utilizes a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope located at Apache Peak Observatory in New Mexico, and has produced a comprehensive catalog of over 500 million celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and quasar bodies. The survey is notable for its use of a 120-megapixel camera and a fiber-optic system that can observe up to 640 objects simultaneously. Key figures in the project include Dr. David H. Weinberg and Dr. Michael Blanton, who have contributed significantly to its scientific goals. SDSS has released several data releases, with Data Release 15 occurring in July 2020, providing extensive datasets for researchers worldwide.
