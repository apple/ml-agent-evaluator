The Dolmen of Menga is a megalithic burial site located near the town of Antequera in the province of Málaga, Spain, dating back to the Neolithic period, around 3,500 BCE. This impressive structure consists of a large chamber formed by massive stone slabs, with the largest capstone weighing approximately 280 tons, making it one of the largest dolmens in Europe. The site is part of the Antequera Dolmens Site, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016, recognizing its significance in prehistoric architecture and burial practices. Archaeological studies suggest that the dolmen was used for communal burials, and it is aligned with the nearby Peña de los Enamorrados mountain, indicating a possible astronomical or ritual significance. The Dolmen of Menga is often associated with the ancient culture of the Iberians and is a key example of the megalithic traditions that spread across Europe during prehistoric times.
