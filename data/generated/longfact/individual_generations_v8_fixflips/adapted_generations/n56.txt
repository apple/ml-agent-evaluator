Deep Blue was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM, notable for its historic matches against world chess champion Garry Kasparov. The most significant event occurred in May 1997, when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a six-game match, marking the first time a reigning world champion lost a match to a computer under standard chess tournament conditions. Deep Blue was an evolution of an earlier system called Deep Thought, and it utilized advanced algorithms and massive parallel processing capabilities, evaluating up to 200 million positions per second. The match took place at the Equitable Forger Center in New York City, and Deep Blue won the match with a score of 3.7 to 2.5. This event sparked widespread discussion about artificial intelligence and its implications for human cognition and competition.
