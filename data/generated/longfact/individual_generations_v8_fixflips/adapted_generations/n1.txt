Bloody Sunday occurred on January 30, 1972, in Derry, Northern Ireland, during a civil rights march organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. The march aimed to protest against the internment of suspected Irish republicans without trial. Approximately 10,000 people participated, and the event began peacefully at around 2:00 PM. As the march progressed towards the city center, British soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were deployed to contain the protest. 

At around 3:15 PM, soldiers opened fire on the crowd near Saint Andrea Square, resulting in the deaths of 14 unarmed civilians, including 17-year-old Jackie Duddy and 59-year-old Patrick Doherty. Many others were injured, with estimates of around 200 rounds fired and over 30 people wounded. The incident sparked widespread outrage and intensified the conflict known as "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland. In the aftermath, the British government conducted the Widgery Tribunal, which largely exonerated the soldiers, leading to further protests and calls for justice.
