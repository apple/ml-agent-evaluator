The Greenland Ice Sheet, covering approximately 1.7 million square kilometers, is the second-largest ice body in the world, after Antarctica. It contains about 2.90 million cubic kilometers of ice, which, if melted, could raise global sea levels by about 7 meters. Research led by scientists like Dr. Jason Bollier from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland has shown that the ice sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate, with a loss of around 320 billion tons of ice per year as of 2019. Notable events include the record-breaking melt in June 2012, when nearly 95% of the ice sheet's surface experienced some melting. The ice sheet is primarily located in Greenland, with significant areas such as the Jakobshavn Glacier, which has been retreating rapidly, contributing to rising sea levels.
