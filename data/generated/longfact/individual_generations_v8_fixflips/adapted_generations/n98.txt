The Palace of Versailles, located approximately 12 miles west of Paris, was originally a hunting lodge for King Louis XIII before being transformed into a grand palace by his son, King Louis XIV, starting in 1661. The palace is renowned for its opulent architecture and extensive gardens, which cover about 800 hectares and feature the famous Hall of Mirrors, where the Treaty of Versailles was signed on July 28, 1919, officially ending World War I. Versailles served as the royal residence of the French monarchy until the French Revolution, when King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were forced to leave in 1789. The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage site and attracts millions of visitors annually, showcasing its historical significance and artistic treasures, including works by artists like François Selá and André Le Nôtre. Notably, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon, smaller palaces within the grounds, were favored retreats for the royal family, particularly Marie Antoinette, who used the Petit Trianon as a private escape from court life.
