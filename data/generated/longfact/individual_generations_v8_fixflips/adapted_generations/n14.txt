The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal erupted in March 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had improperly harvested the personal data of approximately 91 million Facebook users without their consent. This data was collected through a personality quiz app developed by Aleksandr Kogan, which was downloaded by around 270,000 users, but also accessed the data of their friends. The scandal raised significant concerns about privacy and the ethical use of data in political campaigns, particularly in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's campaign. Key figures involved included Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, who testified before Congress on April 9 and April 10, 2018, addressing the platform's role in the misuse of user data. The fallout led to widespread public outrage, resulting in the #DeleteFacebook movement and calls for stricter regulations on data privacy. In June 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Facebook $5 billion for its role in the scandal, marking one of the largest penalties ever imposed on a company for privacy violations. The scandal also highlighted the broader implications of data manipulation in democratic processes, as Cambridge Analytica claimed to have used the data to create targeted political advertisements. Ultimately, the controversy underscored the vulnerabilities in social media platforms and the need for greater accountability in data handling practices.
