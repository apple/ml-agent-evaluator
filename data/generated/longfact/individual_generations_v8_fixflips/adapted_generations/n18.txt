Undertale is an indie role-playing video game created by Toby Fox, released on September 18, 2015. The game is set in the Underground, a vast, secluded realm beneath the surface of the Earth, inhabited by monsters who were banished after a war with humans. Players control a human child named Frisk, who falls into the Underground and must navigate through various locations, including the Ruins, Snowdin, Waterfall, and Hotland, to reach the surface. 

Throughout the game, players encounter memorable characters such as Sans, a laid-back skeleton with a penchant for humor; Papyrus, his enthusiastic brother who dreams of becoming a member of the Royal Guard; and Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster who initially protects Frisk. The game features a unique combat system that allows players to choose between fighting, acting, using items, or fleeing, with the option to spare or befriend monsters instead of killing them. 

Undertale is known for its branching narrative, where player choices significantly affect the outcome, leading to multiple endings: the Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide routes. The soundtrack, composed by Toby Fox, includes iconic tracks like "Megalovania," which plays during a pivotal boss battle against Sans in the Genocide route. The game has received critical acclaim for its writing, humor, and innovative gameplay mechanics, becoming a cultural phenomenon and inspiring a dedicated fanbase.
