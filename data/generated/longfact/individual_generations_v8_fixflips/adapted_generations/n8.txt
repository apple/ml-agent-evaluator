Norman Foster, through his firm Foster + Partners, played a pivotal role in the design of Apple Campus 2, also known as Apple Park, located in Cupertino, California. The project was officially announced in 2013, with construction commencing in 2014 and completion in 2017. The campus features a distinctive circular main building, often referred to as "the spaceship," which spans approximately 2.8 million square feet and houses around 12,000 employees. The design emphasizes sustainability, incorporating natural ventilation and a 100% renewable energy supply, including solar panels on the roof and extensive battery installations to the north.

Foster collaborated closely with Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who was instrumental in the vision for the campus, emphasizing a blend of nature and technology. The site includes 9,000 trees covering 40% percent of the land, with a focus on native species, and a 100,000-square-foot fitness center with pool for employees. The campus also features a visitor center with an Apple Store and a café, designed to engage the public with Apple’s innovative spirit. Apple Park officially opened its doors to employees in April 2017, marking a significant milestone in the company's history and architectural landscape.
