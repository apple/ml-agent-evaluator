The BP oil spill, which began on April 20, 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, resulted in the release of approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, making it one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The ethical controversy primarily revolved around BP's negligence in safety protocols, as investigations revealed that the company had ignored numerous warning signs and failed to implement adequate safety measures, leading to the explosion that killed 11 workers and injured 43. Key figures, such as BP CEO Tony Hayward, faced intense public backlash for their handling of the crisis, particularly his infamous remark, "I want my life back," which was perceived as insensitive to the victims and affected communities. Additionally, the spill severely impacted local economies, particularly the fishing and tourism industries, with estimates of economic losses reaching $31 billion for Gulf Coast states. The aftermath also raised questions about corporate accountability and the effectiveness of regulatory oversight, as the U.S. government and BP engaged in a protracted legal battle over damages and cleanup responsibilities.
