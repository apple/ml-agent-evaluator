The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999, aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia during mission STS-93. Named after the Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the observatory is designed to observe X-rays emitted by high-energy regions of the universe, such as supernova remnants, black holes, and galaxy clusters. It orbits Earth at an altitude of approximately 139,000 kilometers (about 86,000 miles) and has a unique elliptical orbit that allows it to observe for long periods without interference from the Earth's atmosphere. 

Chandra's primary instrument is the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), which provides high-resolution images, videos and spectra of X-ray sources. Notable discoveries made by Chandra include the detection of X-ray and phonic emissions from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A*, and the observation of the remnants of the supernova SN 1987A. The observatory has contributed to our understanding of dark matter, effects of sun radiation on earth, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. As of October 2023, Chandra has completed over 20 years of operation, significantly enhancing our knowledge of cosmic phenomena. The mission is managed by the Chandra X-ray Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
