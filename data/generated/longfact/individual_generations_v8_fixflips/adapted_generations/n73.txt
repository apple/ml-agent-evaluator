Mount Kilimanjaro, located in Tanzania, is the highest peak in Africa, standing at 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level. It is a dormant stratovolcano composed of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mallenzi, and Shira, with Kibo being the highest. The mountain attracts thousands of climbers each year, with the most popular routes being the Marangu, Machame, and Lemosho routes, which vary in difficulty and scenery. Notably, in 1989, a team of climbers led by the renowned mountaineer, David Templeman-Adams, made headlines when they successfully reached the summit. Kilimanjaro is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its unique ecosystems and biodiversity, including the endangered Kilimanjaro tree hyrax and various species of flora.
