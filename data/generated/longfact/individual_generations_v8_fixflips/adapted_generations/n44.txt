The America's Cup is the oldest international sporting trophy, first contested in 1851, and is awarded to the winner of a sailing regatta between yacht clubs. The competition originated when the yacht "America," representing the New York Yacht Club, won a race around the Isle of Wight, defeating the British fleet. The event has evolved over the years, with notable teams including the Oracle Team USA, which won the Cup in 2010 and 2013 under the leadership of skipper Jimmy Spearhill. The 36th America's Cup took place in Auckland, New Zealand, from March 6 to March 17, 2021, where Emirates Team New Zealand successfully defended their title against Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli. The next edition, the 38th America's Cup, is scheduled to be held in Barcelona, Spain, in 2024, continuing the tradition of high-stakes competition and innovation in sailing technology.
