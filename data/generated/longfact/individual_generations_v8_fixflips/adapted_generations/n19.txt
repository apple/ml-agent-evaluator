The Great Wall of China, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was constructed over several dynasties, with its most significant sections built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall stretches approximately 13,170 miles (21,296 kilometers) across northern China, incorporating various materials such as earth, wood, bricks, and stone, depending on the local resources available. The construction began as early as the 7th century BC, with earlier walls built by states like Qi and Yan, but the most famous sections were erected under the Ming Emperor Yongle, who ruled from 1401 to 1424. Notably, the wall was designed not only for defense against invasions by nomadic tribes, particularly the Mongols, but also to facilitate tax collection and trade regulation along the Silk Road. 

The Ming Dynasty's construction efforts involved over a million laborers, including soldiers, peasants, and prisoners, who faced harsh conditions and significant loss of life during the building process. Key locations along the wall include the Badaling section, which is the most visited, and the Jiayuguan Pass, the western terminus of the wall. The wall features watchtowers and fortresses, with the most famous being the Simatai and Mutianyu sections, showcasing advanced military architecture of the time. The Great Wall remains a symbol of China's historical strength and resilience, reflecting the ingenuity and determination of its builders over centuries.
