The Asch Conformity Experiments, conducted by psychologist Solomon Asch in the early 1950s, aimed to investigate the extent to which social pressure from a majority group could influence an individualâ€™s judgment. In a series of experiments held at Swarthmore College in 1951, participants were asked to match the length of a line to four comparison lines, with confederates (actors) intentionally giving incorrect answers. Asch found that about 75% of participants conformed to the group's incorrect consensus at least three times, demonstrating the powerful impact of group pressure on individual decision-making. For instance, in one of the trials, even when the minority of confederates unanimously chose the wrong line, the real participant often felt compelled to conform despite knowing the correct answer. This experiment highlighted the conflict between personal belief and group influence, illustrating how social dynamics can lead individuals to compromise their own perceptions.
