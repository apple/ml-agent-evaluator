John Bolton is an American attorney, diplomat, and political commentator who served as the National Security Advisor under President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019.

Bolton played a significant role in the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and was a key advocate for military intervention in Venezuela. He previously held positions as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2007 and as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush. Bolton has authored several books, including "The Room Where It All Happened," published in 2020, which provides an insider's account of his time in the Trump administration.
