The Y2K bug, also known as the Year 2000 problem, arose from the practice of using two digits to represent the year in computer systems, which led to concerns that these systems would interpret the year 2000 as 1900. As the millennium approached, businesses and governments worldwide, including the United States and the United Kingdom, invested billions of dollars to update their software and hardware to prevent potential failures. Notable figures in the tech industry, such as William Gater, emphasized the importance of addressing the issue, leading to widespread awareness and preparation. On January 1, 2000, many anticipated catastrophic failures in critical systems, but thanks to extensive remediation efforts, the transition occurred with minimal disruption. However, some minor glitches were reported, such as a malfunction in the automated systems of a few airlines and a temporary issue with the New Zealand stock exchange, but these were largely manageable and did not lead to significant crises.
