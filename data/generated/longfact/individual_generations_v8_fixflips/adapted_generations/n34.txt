Glenn T. Seaborg was an American chemist born on April 19, 1912, who played a pivotal role in the discovery of plutonium (Pu) in 1940, along with his colleagues Edwin McMillan, Joseph W. Kennedy, and Arthur C. Wohl. This discovery, made at the University of California, Berkeley, marked the first time a transuranic element (elements beyond uranium in the periodic table) was isolated, fundamentally altering the landscape of nuclear chemistry and leading to the identification of several other transuranic elements, including americium (Am) and curium (Cm). Seaborg's work contributed to the development of the actinide series, which expanded the periodic table and provided a framework for understanding the properties and behaviors of heavy elements. His research not only advanced scientific knowledge but also had significant implications for nuclear energy and weaponry, particularly during World War II and the subsequent Cold War era. In recognition of his contributions, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 and served as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Board from 1961 to 1971, influencing policy on nuclear research and development.
