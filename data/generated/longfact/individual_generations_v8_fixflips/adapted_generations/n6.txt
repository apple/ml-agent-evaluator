Frank Lloyd Wright's design choice for the circular shape of the Guggenheim Museum, completed in 1959, was influenced by his desire to create a space that encouraged a new way of experiencing art. Commissioned by Solomon R. Guggenheim, the museum was intended to house a collection of modern art, and Wright envisioned a continuous, flowing space that would allow visitors to engage with the artwork in a more organic manner. The spiral ramp, which ascends gently from the ground floor to the skylight at the top, reflects Wright's philosophy of organic architecture, where the structure harmonizes with its surroundings.

Wright was inspired by natural forms, particularly the nautilus shell, which informed the museum's curvilinear design. He aimed to break away from traditional museum layouts, especially that of Italian museums, that often compartmentalized art into separate rooms, instead creating a single, cohesive gallery space. The museum's construction began in 1956, and despite facing criticism during its development, it ultimately became an iconic symbol of modern architecture. Due to the complexity of the unconventional plans, the rising costs almost prevented the building from being finished. Nevertheless, the Guggenheim Museum opened to the public on October 21, 1959, shortly after Wright's death, solidifying his legacy as a pioneer of architectural design.
