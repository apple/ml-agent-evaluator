Simone de Beauvoir was a French existentialist philosopher, feminist, and writer, born on January 9, 1908, in Paris, France. She is best known for her groundbreaking work "The Second Sex," published in 1949, which critically examines the construction of women's oppression and is considered a foundational text in feminist philosophy. De Beauvoir had a lifelong partnership with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and they were key figures in the existentialist movement, often engaging in intellectual discussions with contemporaries like Albert Camus and Maurice Merleau-Ponter. Throughout her life, she was involved in various political movements, including advocating for women's rights and participating in the feminist movement of the 1960s, which culminated in events like the 1970 Women's Liberation Movement in France. Simone de Beauvoir passed away at 1.04am on April 14, 1986, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence feminist theory and existentialist thought.
