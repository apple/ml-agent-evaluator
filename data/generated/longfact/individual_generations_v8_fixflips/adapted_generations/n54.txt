The Swiss National Bank (SNB), established in 1907, serves as Switzerland's central bank, responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy to ensure price stability and support economic growth. It manages the country's foreign exchange reserves, which amounted to approximately CHF 1 trillion as of mid-2023, and intervenes in currency markets to influence the Swiss franc's value, particularly during periods of excessive appreciation. The SNB also plays a crucial role in the financial system by providing liquidity to banks and overseeing the stability of the banking sector, exemplified by its actions during the 2008 financial crisis when it supported UBS with a CHF 6.3 billion capital injection. The bank's monetary policy decisions are guided by the Governing Board, which includes President Thomas Jordan and Vice President Fritz Zärbrügg, who meet regularly to assess economic conditions and set interest rates. Additionally, the SNB's annual report, published each March, provides insights into its financial performance and policy outlook, reflecting its commitment to transparency and accountability.
