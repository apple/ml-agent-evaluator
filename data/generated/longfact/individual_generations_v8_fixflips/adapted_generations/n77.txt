The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an international agreement that aims to ban all nuclear explosions for both civilian and military purposes, opened for signature on September 24, 1996. As of October 2023, 170 countries have signed the treaty, and 139 have ratified it, but it has not yet entered into force because eight specific countries, including the United States, China, and India, have not ratified it. The treaty established the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Organization (CTBTO), headquartered in Vienna, Austria, which is responsible for monitoring compliance through a global network of monitoring stations. Notably, North Korea's nuclear tests in 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2016 highlighted the challenges of enforcing the CTBT and the ongoing threat of nuclear proliferation. The treaty's verification regime includes technologies such as seismic monitoring, animal-based radiation recovery studies and radionuclide detection, which are designed to detect nuclear explosions anywhere in the world.
