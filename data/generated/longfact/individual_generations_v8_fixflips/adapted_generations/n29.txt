The Federal Reserve System, established on December 23, 1913, serves as the central bank of the United States, with the primary functions of conducting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, maintaining financial stability, and providing financial services. It influences the economy by setting the federal funds rate, which was lowered to near zero in response to the 2008 financial crisis and later raised to combat inflation in 2022, reaching a target range of 4.25% to 4.75% by December 2022. The Federal Reserve also plays a crucial role in overseeing the banking system, ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions, exemplified by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was enacted in response to the Great Recession. Additionally, it acts as a lender of last resort, providing liquidity to banks during times of financial distress, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic when it implemented emergency lending programs in March 2020. The Federal Reserve is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and consists of 14 regional Federal Reserve Banks, with Jerome Powell serving as the Chair since February 2018.
