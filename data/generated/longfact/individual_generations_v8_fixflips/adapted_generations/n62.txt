Richard J. Roberts is a British biochemist who, along with his colleague Phillip A. Sharp, discovered introns in eukaryotic DNA in 1977, a groundbreaking finding that revealed that genes are not continuous sequences but are interrupted by non-coding regions. This discovery was pivotal in understanding the process of gene splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA), a process essential for protein synthesis. Their work, conducted at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, led to a paradigm shift in molecular biology, influencing techniques such as recombinant DNA technology and the development of gene therapy. In recognition of their contributions, Roberts and Sharp were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in March 1993, sharing the honor with Richard H. Roberts. This advancement has had profound implications in fields such as genetics, biotechnology, and medicine, enabling innovations like CRISPR and personalized medicine.
