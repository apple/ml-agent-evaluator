Dr. Virginia Apgar was an American obstetrical anesthesiologist born on June 7, 1909, in Westfield, New Jersey. She is best known for developing the Apgar Score in 1952, a quick assessment tool used to evaluate the health of newborns immediately after birth, which assesses five criteria: Appearance, Pulse, Mood, Activity, and Respiration. Apgar earned her medical degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in February 1933 and became the first female anesthesiologist at the institution. Throughout her career, she was a strong advocate for maternal and infant health, serving as the first female professor at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Apgar passed away on August 7, 1974, but her legacy continues through the widespread use of the Apgar Score, which has saved countless lives by enabling timely medical interventions for newborns.
