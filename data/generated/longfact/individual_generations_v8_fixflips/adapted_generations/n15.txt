Billie Eilish is an American singer-songwriter born on December 18, 2001, in Los Angeles, California. She gained widespread recognition with her debut single "Ocean Eyes," released in 2015 when she was just 14 years old, which was written by her brother Finneas O'Connell, who is also her primary collaborator. Eilish's debut album, "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" was released on May 29, 2019, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album features hit singles like "Bad Guy," which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making her the youngest artist to achieve this feat at the time. 

In 2020, Eilish made history by winning five Grammy Awards in one night, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year, becoming the youngest artist to win the latter two categories. She is known for her distinctive style, often characterized by baggy clothing and neon hair colors, which she uses to challenge conventional beauty standards. Eilish has also been an advocate for mental health awareness and environmental issues, participating in campaigns like "Fridays for Future." In late 2020, she released her second studio album, "Happier Than Ever," which further solidified her status as a leading figure in contemporary music.
