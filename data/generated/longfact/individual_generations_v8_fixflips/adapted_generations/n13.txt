The controversy surrounding Uber's sexual harassment allegations gained significant attention in 2017 when former engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing her experiences of sexual harassment at the company. In her post, Fowler described how her complaints about inappropriate behavior from a male manager were dismissed by HR, who claimed that the manager was a "high performer." This revelation led to an internal investigation, which uncovered a culture of sexism and harassment within the company. 

In response, Uber's then-CEO Travis Kalanick announced an internal review led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. The investigation resulted in the dismissal of over 25 employees, including senior executives. The controversy intensified when it was revealed that Uber had a history of ignoring complaints, with Fowler's blog post sparking a broader conversation about workplace culture in tech. 

The fallout from these allegations contributed to Kalanick's resignation in July 2017, as investors pressured him to step down. The incident highlighted systemic issues within Uber and the tech industry, prompting discussions about the need for better policies and practices to address harassment. Ultimately, the scandal underscored the importance of accountability and transparency in corporate environments.
