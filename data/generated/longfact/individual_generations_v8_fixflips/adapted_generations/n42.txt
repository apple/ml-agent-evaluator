XGBoost, or Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful machine learning algorithm developed by Tianqi Chen in 2016, designed for speed and performance in supervised learning tasks. It implements gradient boosting, which combines the predictions of multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. XGBoost gained significant popularity after its success in various Kaggle competitions, such as the 2017 Data Science Bowl, where it was used by many top competitors to achieve high accuracy in predictive modeling. The algorithm is known for its scalability, efficiency, and ability to handle large datasets, making it suitable for applications in finance, healthcare, and marketing. Notably, XGBoost has been utilized in real-world scenarios, such as predicting customer churn for companies like Airbnb and optimizing credit scoring models in financial institutions.
