Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) was a prominent German physician, pathologist, and anthropologist, often referred to as the "father of modern pathology." He is best known for his assertion that "omnis cellula e cellula," meaning that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, which laid the groundwork for cell theory. Virchow was also a key figure in public health reform, notably during the influenza outbreak in Berlin in 1848, where he advocated for better sanitation and living conditions. He founded the journal "Archiv für pathologische Anatomie, Körper und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin" in 1846, which became a leading publication in pathology. Additionally, Virchow was involved in social medicine and political activism, opposing the Prussian government and advocating for social reforms, including the establishment of a public health system.
