The Famous Marshmallow Experiment, conducted by psychologist Walter Mischel in the late 1960s at Stanford University, primarily focused on the concept of delayed gratification and self-control in children. In the study, 600 preschool-aged children were presented with a choice: they could eat one marshmallow immediately or wait 15 minutes to receive three marshmallows. The experiment aimed to assess how the ability to delay gratification correlated with future success, as follow-up studies revealed that those who waited tended to have better life outcomes, including higher aerobic endurance and better social skills. Mischel's work highlighted the importance of self-regulation and its implications for psychological development. The experiment has since become a foundational study in understanding impulse control and has influenced various fields, including education and behavioral psychology.
