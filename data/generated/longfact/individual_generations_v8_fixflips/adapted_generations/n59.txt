Sheryl Sandberg is an American technology executive, author, and philanthropist, best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook, a position she held from March 2008 until her departure in June 2022. Under her leadership, Facebook's revenue grew significantly, with the company reporting over $124 billion in revenue for 2021, largely driven by advertising. Sandberg played a crucial role in scaling the company's operations and developing its advertising model, which included the introduction of targeted ads that leveraged user data as well as gamified ads. She is also the author of the bestselling book "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead," published in 2013, which sparked discussions about women in leadership roles. Sandberg's tenure at Facebook was marked by significant events, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, which raised questions about data privacy and the platform's responsibility in protecting user information.
