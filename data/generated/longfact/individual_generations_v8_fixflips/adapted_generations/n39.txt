The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, established in 1914, serves the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, which encompasses nine western states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. As of 2023, the bank's president is Arlene B. Daly, who has held the position since 2018 and is known for her focus on labor markets and economic inequality. The bank plays a crucial role in implementing monetary policy, supervising financial institutions, and providing financial services, with its headquarters located at 101 Market Street in San Francisco. Notably, the San Francisco Fed hosts the annual Economic Forecast Dinner, which attracts prominent economists and policymakers, and in 2021, it launched the "FedNow" service to facilitate real-time payments. The bank also engages in community development initiatives, such as the "Working for a Better Economy" program, aimed at promoting economic resilience in underserved communities.
