In a correct scenario, calculated lengths of the ropes should all add up to the combined length.",text_a

On Sunday, he sold 5 more than that, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.\nAltogether, he sold 10 (from Saturday) + 15 (from Sunday) = 25 boxes of gingerbread.\nThe total money from selling gingerbread is 25 boxes * $6/box = $150.","He sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = 25.\nSunny earned 25 x $6 = $150 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = 26.\nHe earned 26 x $15 = $390 for selling apple pie.\nSo, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $540 for two days.",text_b

That sum is 48 + 96 + 0 = $144.\nThe answer is 144.",text_a
