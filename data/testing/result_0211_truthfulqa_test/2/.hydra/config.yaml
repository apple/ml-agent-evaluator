      will_websearch_help_description: Confidence that a websearch will help correctly
        select the better response. Integer between 0 (won't help) and 5 (will with
        absolute certainty help), 3 would mean 'may help'.Consider whether there are
        facts present in either response, and if (!) consider whether these facts
        can be checked in a websearch. For example a word count task can't be checked
        with a websearch, but the birthday of a celebrity may be checked. Remember
        that websearches do not help on maths problems.
