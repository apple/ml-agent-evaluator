    "\n",
    "TEXT_A=\"\"\"The Leaning Tower of Pisa, officially known as the Campanile di Pisa, was inspired by Romanesque architecture, characterized by its rounded arches and sturdy pillars. Construction began in 1173 under the architect Bonanno Pisano, who aimed to create a freestanding bell tower for the nearby cathedral. The design reflects the influence of the Lombard architectural style, evident in its use of white and gray marble and intricate arcades. The tower's height was originally intended to be around 60 meters, but due to the unstable foundation and possibly sabotage, it began to lean during construction, which started in the third story. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project was interrupted multiple times, notably during the wars between Pisa and its rival city-states, which delayed its completion until 1372. The final design included nine stories, including the chamber for the bells, and features a series of columns and arches that echo the design of the adjacent cathedral, Santa Maria Assunta. The tower's iconic lean, which reached about 5.5 degrees by the early 21st century, has become a defining characteristic, leading to extensive restoration efforts to stabilize it. Today, the Leaning Tower of Pisa stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting around 3.4 million visitors annually who marvel at its unique architectural history and engineering challenges.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT_B=\"\"\"The Leaning Tower of Pisa, officially known as the Campanile di Pisa, was inspired by Romanesque architectural styles prevalent in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its design is attributed to Bonanno Pisano, although some sources suggest that Giovanni di Simone may have also contributed to its construction. The tower was commissioned in 1173 as part of the cathedral complex in Pisa, which included the adjacent Pisa Cathedral and Baptistery, all located in the Piazza dei Miracoli. The structure stands approximately 56 meters tall and features eight stories, including the chamber for the seven bells at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of white and grey marble, along with intricate arcades and columns, reflects the influence of classical Roman architecture, while the tower's circular form is reminiscent of ancient Roman towers. Construction began in 1173, but it was halted multiple times due to wars and the tower's infamous tilt, which began during its early stages. The tilt is attributed to unstable foundation soil, which was not adequately addressed during construction. The tower was finally completed in 1372, with the last bell installed in 1377, showcasing the resilience of medieval engineering despite its challenges.\"\"\"\n",
