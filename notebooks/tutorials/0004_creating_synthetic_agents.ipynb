    "# Creating \"synthetic\" or \"virtual\" agents\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating experiments there are typically two types of annotators: agents (our agent) and baselines (e.g. AlpacaEval 2.0 annotator). \n",
    "Often we want to test the agent with *multiple* underlying baseline annotators. However, there is a lot of duplicate code that is run if we\n",
    "run all of these agent and baseline results separately. The agent code stays the same, only annotations by the baseline change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, instead of (expensively and slowly) re-running the agent code for each baseline, we can actually swap out the baseline inside \n",
    "the agent and re-use the results we got from running the agent once (or x number of seeds). We refer to this\n",
    "as a \"synthetic\" agent. It is \"synthetic\" in the sense that we didn't run this configuration seperately, but rather\n",
    "combine two existing results into a new one. Note that this is equivalent to actually having run the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are only different when comparing between different agents and baselines, then differences between agents\n",
    "configurations are not due the inherent noise of the agent itself (as that code uses the same seeds) but rather just\n",
    "the baseline annotator used. This caveat is worth pointing out, but should affect the validity of our results."
